# PySpark MapReduce on Jupyter Notebook
Implements the common friends MapReduce algorithm using pyspark on a jupyter notebook

This project was getting myself aquanted to using jupyter notebook and spark together. My Big Data course is using google colab so I wanted to spend time
figuring out how to use that stuff outside of googles educational tool. 

For explanations of the code just look at the notebook, its formatted there better than I can format here.
